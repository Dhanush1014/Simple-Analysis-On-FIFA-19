## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using FIFA 2019 complete player dataset to better understand:
1. Best players in various aspects ?
2. How age has an impact on the player's potential?
3. Build a model to predict overall performance of the player?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The above three questions are handles in a single notebook - [FIFA 2019 Linear Regression](https://github.com/Dhanush1014/Simple-Analysis-On-FIFA-19/blob/master/FIFA%202019%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb).  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().
